# 🗳️ Secure E-Voting System

A **robust, time-locked secure e-voting application** built using **Python (Flask)**, cryptographic modules, and a **blockchain-style ledger** with tamper-proof vote storage.  
This project ensures each vote is securely **encrypted**, **stored**, and **verified**, enabling **trust and transparency** in digital elections.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🧩 Multi-Service Architecture
- **Main Application (`app.py`)** – Handles user authentication, registration, and voting.
- **Encryption Service (`encryption_service.py`)** – Encrypts votes using RSA and simulates time-locks for delayed decryption.
- **Storage Service (`storage_service.py`)** – Manages the encrypted ledger, tallying, and export functions.

### 🔗 Blockchain-Style Ledger
Each vote is linked through cryptographic hashes to ensure **tamper resistance** and enable **ledger integrity verification**.

### ⏱️ Time-Locked Vote Encryption
Votes are encrypted and **only decrypted after a preset interval**, ensuring confidentiality until the official count.

### 🧮 Admin Dashboard
Visualize results, tally votes, export reports, and verify ledger integrity from a single interface.

### 📊 Export & Reporting
Generate **results, ledgers, integrity proofs**, and **cryptanalysis graphs** for detailed evaluation.

## 🗳️ Usage

1. **Register a Voter** – Use the Register page with Voter ID and password.  
2. **Login & Vote** – Each voter can vote only once.  
3. **Vote Encryption** – Votes are RSA-encrypted and time-locked before storage.  
4. **Vote Storage** – Encrypted votes are stored via the Storage API in a blockchain-linked ledger.  
5. **Admin Tools** –  
   - Tally votes (after time-lock expires)  
   - View and export results  
   - Verify blockchain linkage  
   - Generate security and ledger reports

## 🔐 Security Model

| Mechanism | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Encryption** | RSA-2048 for vote data, SHA-256 for hashing |
| **One-Time Voting** | Prevents double-voting through voter status tracking |
| **Tamper-Evident Ledger** | Hash-linked blocks ensure immutability |
| **Time-Lock Mechanism** | Controlled decryption time prevents early tallying |

## 🩺 Diagnostic Tools

### 🔧 `diagnose.py`
Checks:
- Directory & file integrity  
- Python dependency status  
- Active service ports  
- Encryption key presence  

Run:
```bash
python diagnose.py
```

Outputs a **system health and troubleshooting report**.
